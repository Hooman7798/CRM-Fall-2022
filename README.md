# CRM-Fall-2022-Final-Project
This is my final Project of CRM course at University of Isfahan in Fall 2022 semester.In this Project, I have predicted the repurchase possibility of the customers using Decision tree, MLP and Naive Bayes algorithms.In terms of F1-score, Decision tree algorithm has the best performance between these algorithm. Moreover, Two approaches based on RFM(Recency, Frequancy and Monetary) has implemented to cluster the customers.
